# Ganymede
An app indicator for starting and stopping jupyter notebook

# What's in the name?
Ganymede is Jupiter's and our solar system's largest moon so you know where the idea from the name comes from.

# Why?
I created this because the hacker in me hated the idea of booting ubuntu, running a terminal and typing the command. So I created this app indicator. This gives you option to start and stop the server from a tray icon on the top right.
